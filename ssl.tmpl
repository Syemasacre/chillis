# To use your own ssl cert (e.g. "Let's Encrypt"), please create symbol link to
# ssl cert/key used below, so that we can manage this config file with Ansible.

# For example:
#
# rm -f /etc/ssl/private/iRedMail.key
# rm -f /etc/ssl/certs/iRedMail.crt
# ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem /etc/ssl/private/iRedMail.key
# ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem /etc/ssl/certs/iRedMail.crt

# To request free "Let's Encrypt" cert, please check our tutorial:
